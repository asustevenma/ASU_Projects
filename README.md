# Milestone Project - Sentiment Analysis
In the text mining project, we are given a list of twitter influencers. We have to do sentiment analysis by analyzing the tweets.
* The tweets are already extracted by Python tweepy package into csv file
* Applying Naive Bayes Classifier to determint the sentiment of a certain tweet
* The training set is a set with lots of tweets, each of them is lebeled as 'Positive' or 'Negative'
* The testing set is the tweets from targeted influencers

# SABR Diamond Dollars Case Competition(2018)
This was a data analytics competition about baseball. The task was finding the optimal launch angle for 3 major league baseball players, and predicting the impact on their performance.

* This project is the 2018 Diamond Dollars Case Competition, which was held by SABR(Society for American Baseball Research), during the SABR Analytics Conference at the Hyatt Regency Phoenix in Phoenix, Arizona. In this year's case, we were asked to evaluate the relationship between launch angle and exit velocity, using data from MLB Statcast, BaseballSavant.com, and other publicly available tools, and then determine the optimal launch angle for four major-league hitters
* Applying Random Forest to predict the outcome of each "hit-into-play" under a simulation of different scenarios(eg. pitch type, pitch speed, RHP/LHP, spin rate., etc.)
